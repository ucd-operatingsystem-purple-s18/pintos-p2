	   You must ensure that Pintos does not terminate until the initial process exits.
   The  supplied  Pintos  code  tries  to  do  this  by  calling process_wait() (in‘userprog/process.c’) 
   from main() (in ‘threads/init.c’). We suggest that you implement process_wait() according to the 
   comment at the top of the function and then implement the wait system call in terms of process_wait().
   All of a process’s resources, including its struct thread , must be freed whether its parent ever waits 
   for it or not, and regardless of whether the child exits before or after its parent. Children are 
   not inherited: if A has child B and B has child C, then wait(C) always returns immediately when 
   called from A, even if B is dead. Consider all the ways a wait can occur: nested waits (A waits for
   B, then B waits for C), multiple waits (A waits for B, then A waits for C), and so on.
   Implementing this system call requires considerably more work than any of the rest */
