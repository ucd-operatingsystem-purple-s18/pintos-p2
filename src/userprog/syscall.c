    int wait (pid t pid )
      [System Call]
    Waits for a child process pid and retrieves the child’s exit status.
    If pid is still alive, waits until it terminates. Then, returns the status that pid passed
    to exit. If pid did not call exit(), but was terminated by the kernel (e.g. killed due
    to an exception), wait(pid) must return -1. It is perfectly legal for a parent process
    to wait for child processes that have already terminated by the time the parent calls
    wait, but the kernel must still allow the parent to retrieve its child’s exit status, or
    learn that the child was terminated by the kernel.
    wait must fail and return -1 immediately if any of the following conditions is true:
        
        • pid does not refer to a direct child of the calling process. pid is a direct child
        of the calling process if and only if the calling process received pid as a return
        value from a successful call to exec.
        Note that children are not inherited: if A spawns child B and B spawns child
        process C, then A cannot wait for C, even if B is dead. A call to wait(C) by
        process A must fail. Similarly, orphaned processes are not assigned to a new
        parent if their parent process exits before they do.

        • The process that calls wait has already called wait on pid. That is, a process
        may wait for any given child at most once.
        
    Processes may spawn any number of children, wait for them in any order, and may
    even exit without having waited for some or all of their children. Your design should
    consider all the ways in which waits can occur. All of a process’s resources, including
    its struct thread, must be freed whether its parent ever waits for it or not, and
    regardless of whether the child exits before or after its parent.
    You must ensure that Pintos does not terminate until the initial process exits.
    The supplied Pintos code tries to do this by calling process_wait() (in
    ‘userprog/process.c’) from main() (in ‘threads/init.c’). We suggest that you
    implement process_wait() according to the comment at the top of the function
    and then implement the wait system call in terms of process_wait().
    Implementing this system call requires considerably more work than any of the rest.

    /*
The file defines other syscalls. Ignore them for now. You will implement some of them
in project 3 and the rest in project 4, so be sure to design your system with extensibility in
mind.

To implement syscalls, you need to provide ways to read and write data in user virtual
address space. You need this ability before you can even obtain the system call number,
because the system call number is on the user’s stack in the user’s virtual address space. This
can be a bit tricky: what if the user provides an invalid pointer, a pointer into kernel memory,
or a block partially in one of those regions? You should handle these cases by terminating
the user process. We recommend writing and testing this code before implementing any
other system call functionality. See Section 3.1.5 [Accessing User Memory], page 27, for
more information.

You must synchronize system calls so that any number of user processes can make them
at once. In particular, it is not safe to call into the file system code provided in the ‘filesys’
directory from multiple threads at once. Your system call implementation must treat the
file system code as a critical section. Don’t forget that process_execute() also accesses
files. For now, we recommend against modifying code in the ‘filesys’ directory.
We have provided you a user-level function for each system call in ‘lib/user/syscall.c’.
These provide a way for user processes to invoke each system call from a C program. Each
uses a little inline assembly code to invoke the system call and (if appropriate) returns the
system call’s return value.

When you’re done with this part, and forevermore, Pintos should be bulletproof. Nothing
that a user program can do should ever cause the OS to crash, panic, fail an assertion, or
otherwise malfunction. It is important to emphasize this point: our tests will try to break
your system calls in many, many ways. You need to think of all the corner cases and handle
them. The sole way a user program should be able to cause the OS to halt is by invoking
the halt system call.

If a system call is passed an invalid argument, acceptable options include returning an
error value (for those calls that return a value), returning an undefined value, or terminating
the process.
